# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction


## Project Overview
The Real Estate Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of real estate properties using various machine learning techniques. This project utilizes historical data to build a predictive model that can assist in estimating the market value of properties based on different features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `Real_Estate.csv`. It contains the following columns:
- `X1 transaction date`: The transaction date
- `X2 house age`: The age of the house
- `X3 distance to the nearest MRT station`: Distance to the nearest MRT station
- `X4 number of convenience stores`: Number of convenience stores nearby
- `X5 latitude`: Latitude of the house
- `X6 longitude`: Longitude of the house
- `Y house price of unit area`: The house price per unit area

**Steps for Analysis**


Load the Dataset: Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values or outliers.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Model Building: Train different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict real estate prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Model Tuning: Tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve their performance.

Visualization: Visualize the results and the performance of the models using plots.


**Summary**

The Real Estate Price Prediction project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting real estate prices using machine learning techniques. By following the steps outlined in this project, you can build a robust predictive model that can assist in estimating property values based on various features.
